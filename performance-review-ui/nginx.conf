# Angular is a Single Page Application (SPA). When a user navigates to a route (e.g., /dashboard), the server must always serve index.html so Angular can handle routing on the client side.
#Nginx, by default, tries to serve files directly from disk.
# If you refresh on /index, Nginx would look for /index as a file or folder and return 404 if not found.

#Serving index.html for all routes that don't match a real file.
#Caching static assets (JS, CSS, images) for performance.
#Listening on the correct port (8081 in your config).

#How does Nginx work with Docker?
#Docker runs Nginx in a container.
#Your Angular app is built and copied into the container.
#Nginx serves the built files from /usr/share/nginx/html.
#The custom config ensures Angular routing works and assets are cached.
